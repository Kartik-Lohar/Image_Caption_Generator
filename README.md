# Image_Caption_Generator
A model which takes an image and give text description of that image.

Note: Here I have used Google Colab for accomplishing this project.
So all the paths of files in the code are according to google drive because I have mounted my google drive.
So before running the code please ensure all the paths.

I learned this project from the dataflair website, So if you have any problems then I have attached the link of that website. 

The link of the dataset I have used are:
